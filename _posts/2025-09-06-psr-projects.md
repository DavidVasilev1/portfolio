*Integration thoughts*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 1
![Version 1](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis1.png){: width="700"}
*Simplest version of chassis, without much through on integration. It is just the most basic and smallest shape to fit the driver.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 2
![Version 2](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis2.1.png){: width="700"}
*A slightly more complex version of the chassis. This was made with rear and front suspension in mind and more accurate driver dimensions.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}


## Version 3
![Version 3](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis3.png){: width="700"}
*This design contains more through about how forces will flow through the chassis shape. This is reflected in the rear slope of the chassis.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 4
![Version 4](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis4.2.png){: width="700"}
*This version took into account the battery placement and made the driver spacing slightly smaller in an attempt to make the car narrower.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 4](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis4.3.png){: width="700"}
*Thoughts on driver positioning were also developed, to comply with the rules given.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 4](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis4.1.png){: width="700"}
*Battery cooling also began to come into discussion, as this was also a requirement as per the rules.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 4](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis4.5.png){: width="700"}
*This is the chassis in relation to the wheel base and track width. This was used in the CG calculations to make sure the driver was positioned where the CG of the vehicle was.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 5
![Version 5](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis5.1.png){: width="700"}
*This is the first version made using surface modeling. This allows the chassis to take on more natural curves and allows for more freedom designing the shape. I decided to add a natural curve in the back to allow for more natural force flow from the rear suspension to the front of the chassis.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 5](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis5.2.png){: width="700"}
*This is the chassis sitting inside the aeroshell, beginning integration.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 5](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis5.4.png){: width="700"}
*This shows a cross section of how the driver would sit in the chassis, ensuring driver placement rules are followed.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 6
![Version 6](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis6.3.png){: width="700"}
*A more complete version of the chassis. A driver and battery compartment has been added and the chassis has been made wider.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 6](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis6.4.png){: width="700"}
*The top of the chassis where rollcage would be mounting is flattened for easier integration. The natural curves have been kept and the front of the chassis has been lifted to allow for the driver to be squished into a more compact seating position.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 6](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis6.5.png){: width="700"}
*The front view shows how compact the chassis has been made to fit the driver.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 6](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis6.6.png){: width="700"}
*Driver seating position and positioning is more refined in respect to the rules.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 7
![Version 7](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis7.1.png){: width="700"}
*This is a more finalized version integrated into the aeroshell. Rear and front suspension are beginning to integrating and interior panels have been added to support the driver.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

![Version 7](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis7.7.png){: width="700"}
*Integration with brakes and accelerator as well as steering have been added. A more accurate driver model has been added with a helmet and seat backs.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}

## Version 8
![Version 8](/assets/img/post_images/psr/chassis/chassis8.png){: width="700"}
*This is the final version of the chassis. An open front was decided to easier access to components inside the chassis, like brakes and accelerator. To add structural support, a solid carbon ring will be added. Selective coring has also been determined to mounting hardware and integrating with other subsystems.*{: style="font-size:1.3em; display:block; text-align:center;"}
